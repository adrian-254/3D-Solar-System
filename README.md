# 3D Solar System

## Overview

The 3D Solar System project is an interactive web-based visualization of our solar system. It showcases the planets orbiting the Sun in a realistic manner, using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project aims to provide an educational and engaging experience for users to explore planetary motion and scale.

## Features

- **Realistic Orbits:** Planets revolve around the Sun based on their actual speeds and distances.
- **3D Visualization:** Utilizes WebGL or Three.js for rendering.
- **Planet Information:** Clicking on a planet displays details such as size, distance from the Sun, and orbital period.
- **Customizable Settings:** Toggle orbit lines and adjust simulation speed.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** (Three.js for 3D rendering)
- **HTML5 & CSS3** (UI and styling)
- **WebGL** (for rendering 3D graphics)

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/adrian-254/3D-Solar-System.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd 3d-Solar-System
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a browser or use a local server:
   ```sh
   npx http-server
   ```

## Usage

- Open the project in a web browser.
- Use the mouse to rotate the camera and zoom in/out.
- Click on a planet to view details.
- Customize settings through the UI panel.

## Future Enhancements

- Add moons for each planet.
- Improve planetary textures for higher realism.
- Implement real-time planetary positions based on NASA data.
- Add VR support for an immersive experience.
